### Course Description

In this course, we will take a modular approach to build an in-browser graphics engine, which we will use to create a final project. We will work primarily in JavaScript and GLSL, with the help of WebGL (a JavaScript API for rendering graphics on the HTML canvas). In the process we will cover the underlying mathematics, which will consist primarily of geometric principles and linear transformations necessary for conversions between local space, world space, and view space as well as lighting, texturing, reflection, refraction, and other visual effects.

### Weekly Schedule

Lecture content will be covered on Tuesdays (usually in the first hour or so). The remainder of the time will be spend working on labs.

### Grading

Overall course grades will be determined by a weighted average of homework, quizzes, exams, and projects.  

Homework - 20%  
There will be 3-4 homework assignments. These assignments will consist of modules which together will form the engine in which the final project will be built. Homework will be done in groups of 2. 

Quizzes - 0%  
There will be occasional review quizzes. These will not carry any weight in your grade, but they will serve as excellent review materials. Missed quizzes will not be made up.

Exams - 40%  
There will be two midterms worth 10% each and a final exam worth 20%. Exams will be given on paper. Students may bring a single sheet (front and back) of notes for exams. Calculators are allowed but should not be necessary. The first midterm will cover the first five weeks of content. The second midterm will focus primarily on the next four weeks of content, but may include questions from the first five weeks as well. The final exam is cumulative.

Project - 20%  
Projects will consist of a display or scene demonstrating the capabilities of the system build through the homework assignments, as well as a short write-up detailing (ideally in list form) what to look for in the project. Students may choose from the default projects: solar system or a city fly-through. Alternately, students may propose and complete a different project of their choosing. Project proposals will be due on Tuesday of week 12, and should either convey which default project was chosen or propose a different project.

Labs - 20%  
Labs will be due on Monday nights at 11:59 PM, but they should be done earlier; they are intended to be finished in class, as they will often be prerequisites to (or even cover portions of) the homework, which will be due at the same time. Labs will be done in the same groups of 2 as the homework. Lab grades will be reduced by 20% per day late.

Resources:  
There will be no textbook for this course. Content will be covered in lectures, and links to supplementary resources will be provided.

Communication Policy:  
I will make every effort to respond to your email questions within 24 hours Monday through Friday.  
If for some reason you have not received a reply after 24 hours, please feel free to email me again.  
I will try to respond in a timely manner during the weekend as well, but I might not respond until Monday; try to do enough lab work and homework during the week to avoid needing questions answered over the weekend, as weekend emails might not receive responses until Monday.

Attendance:  
While attendance is not mandatory, regular attendance will be necessary to pass.  
Quizzes, exams and labs will not be made up unless an adequate reason is given beforehand, except in extreme circumstances.

### Course Policies

Assignment Submissions:  
All assignments and labs must be submitted through canvas; if the assignment requires more than one file, it should be submitted as a zip file. Email submissions will not be accepted.
Nothing that does not compile / run will be graded.  
Submitted code must be formatted so as to be readable. Spaghetti will receive a half grade penalty.

Late Work:  
No late work will be accepted.  
If technical difficulties prevent submission on canvas, the assignment should be emailed to me before the due date.  
This is the only case in which email submissions will be accepted, and it is your responsibility to approach me, either in office hours or before or after the following class period, to discuss the problem.

### Disability Statement

### Academic Dishonesty

By enrolling at CSU Channel Islands, students are responsible for upholding the University’s policies and the Student Conduct Code. Academic integrity and scholarship are values of the institution that ensure respect for the academic reputation of the University, students, faculty, and staff. Cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized collaboration with another student, knowingly furnishing false information to the University, buying, selling or stealing any material for an examination, or substituting for another person may be considered violations of the Student Conduct Code (located at http://www.csuci.edu/campuslife/student-conduct/academic-dishonesty.htm). If a student is found responsible for committing an act of academic dishonesty in this course, the student may receive academic penalties including a failing grade on an assignment or in the course, and a disciplinary referral will be made and submitted to the Dean of Students office. For additional information, please see the faculty Academic Senate Policy on Academic Dishonesty, also in the CI Catalog. Please ask about my expectations regarding academic dishonesty in this course if they are unclear.

### Course Policies Subject to Change
It is the student’s responsibility to check CILearn for corrections or updates to the syllabus. Any changes will be posted in CILearn.

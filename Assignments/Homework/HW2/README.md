# HW 2 - Models

1. Implement the RGBMesh and UVMesh classes by extending Mesh (these will be done in the labs).
2. Implement utilities for the creation of textured cubes and spheres (this will be mostly done in Lab 5).
3. Create at least 4 simple textured models of objects that are not shaped like regular solids. This is best done during or after Lab 6 with the use of Blender or other modelling software.
   - some examples:
     - traffic cone
     - table
     - chair
     - coffee mug
     - stop sign
4. Extra Credit: Create a textured model of a 20-sided die.

   - Hint2: the 20-sided die takes the shape of a regular icosahedron
   - Hint3: if you plan on using a downloaded texture for a 20-sided die, it may be easiest to load it into your blender file and then mark seams one at a time to match the texture, as opposed to unwrapping your mesh and then trying to fit a texture to it.
5. Display a textured cube, a textured sphere, and all models made during the assignment on a single canvas.

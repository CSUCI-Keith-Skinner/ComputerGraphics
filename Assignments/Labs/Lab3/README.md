# Lab 3 - Quaternions and Rotation

1. Start from the complete Lab 2
2. Complete the following methods:
   - Quaternion.constructor
   - Quaternion.set
   - Quaternion.inverse
   - Quaternion.renormalize
   - Quaternion.compose
   - Quaternion.composition
   - Quaternion.applyRotation
   - Quaternion.localCompose
   - Quaternion.toString
   - Quaternion.fromVector
   - Vector.fromQuaternion
   - Vector.rotate
   - Matrix.rotation
3. Use the Lab 3 test script to ensure everything is working as intended.

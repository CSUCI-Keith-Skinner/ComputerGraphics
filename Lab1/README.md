# Lab 1 - Drawing Triangles
## TODO: this should be updated since the .zip will come with the repo.

1. Follow the instructor through an example demonstrating how to draw a single triangle on an html canvas using WebGL
   - download: [triangleDemo.zip](https://cilearn.csuci.edu/courses/8815/files/1111243/download?wrap=1)
2. Modify this example to draw a picture or write out a message in triangles.
   - Note that multiple triangles can be drawn at once; just put all of the corners' positions in one positions array, and all of the colors in one color array. You do not need to create separate position arrays for each triangle as done in the demo.
3. zip and submit on Canvas.

Your submission should contain everything I need to run your demo. I should not need to add any files to run it.
